                Make a prompt for each space provided in the ###Descriptions### list.
                Your prompts should follow a structure: mentioning the broader characteristics of the space, then the specifics of the space.
                Here are some examples:
                Description: Functional Radial Wings: These extensions house distinct areas such as dining halls, lodging facilities, spas or recreational spaces - each designed to meet specific needs of visitors during their skiing adventure while maintaining visual connections with the central hub and surrounding landscape.
                Prompt: The radial shaped wings of the Ice-cabin hotel host many different facilities, letting the skiing adventure finish in a place of visual connections with the central hub and surrounding landscape.
                Description: Native Landscaping and Pathways: These initiatives merge seamlessly into the existing terrain around the building, reinforcing its connection to Iceland's wilderness. Carefully curated native flora serves as a living boundary while lava rock pathways lead directly from skiing gates to our retreat, further immersing guests in nature's embrace.
                Prompt: The Ice-cabin hotel reinforces its connection to Iceland's wilderness with lava rock pathways leading directly from skiing gates of the retreat.
